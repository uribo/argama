## What's this

The [blogdown](https://bookdown.org/) package that static websites generater using [RMarkdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/) and [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) systems. Blogdown is powerful for R users to easily manage a static blog site. But when managing blogs by teams, it is difficult to maintain due to differences in own environment and package versions.

The argama projects use [docker](https://www.docker.com/) container to solve this problem. By describing the R package and system used for the dockerfile in the repository, you can expect to make the blogdown operation easier on the team.

## How to use

Download this repository as `.zip` archives. Then, you write pass-phase for login to rstudio-server. We recommend like a below files.

```
# save .env
PASSWORD=<your password>
```

Running container using `docker-compose`.

```{bash, eval = FALSE}
cd argama
docker-compose up
```

Open `loccalhost:8787` in blowswer and go to rproject (your blog project).

```{r, eval = FALSE, echo = TRUE}
# Serve site (already setup hugoe and default blog themes)
blogdown::serve_site()
```

Done!

Next, customize from this repository and writing your articles.
